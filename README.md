# ParticleFactory
![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/ParticleFactory.png)

This demo demonstrates the use of the [factory pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) and [runtime polymorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science))

You should never really implement a particle system like this as it's not very efficient, much better using Data Oriented Design approaches to this.
